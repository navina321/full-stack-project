Project Brief:

Work Log:
20/03/23
Researched possible topics for API, chose to do Disney Attractions API. Looked into possible data values API could store e.g attraction name, which park it is in, where in the park it is, average wait time, opening and closing times, if the ride has fast pass, height limits, accessibility, theme, ride type, show times, duration etc. (not all of these will be used in the API). Created React app and linked to gitHub repository, removed unnessecary boilerplate.

21/03/23
Used figma to create layout and design for the front-end part of the project, to see how the website/app will look and get an idea of what components/containers/pages will need to be made along with variables for the styles such as colors and fonts.

22/03/23
Decided on data values API will contain, made API boilerplate using Spring Initializr and added Java Classes: DisneyAttraction, DisneyAttractionsApplication, DisneyAttractionsController, DisneyAttractionsInitilizer, DisneyAttractionsRepository, as well as disneyAttraction.json.
Re-made React App for front-end so in same directory and repository as API.
