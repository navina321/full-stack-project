Large flying foxes, also known as Malayan flying foxes, are bats native to Asia and named for their distinctive vulpine facial features, which include a long snout, oval ears, round eyes and reddish black fur.Unlike other bats that rely on echolocation, these amazing animals use their excellent eyesight and advanced sense of smell to track down their dinner. Their fondness for fruit enriches their surrounding environment, as they disperse the seeds they don’t consume across the forest floor, encouraging new plant growth.After foraging, they return to large colonies (sometimes with over 250,000 other bats) and sleep upside-down hanging from branches or high perches. Their unusual sleeping position is due to the fragile bones in their hindlegs, which are unable to support their full body weight in an upright position."
